                                I prefer being autodidact with the things about my area instead school classes. 
                                For that reason i take many online courses as like Udemy, Edx, Coursera, Udacity, 
                                IBM Cognitive Class, etc.

                                horror movies. I like a lot reading, the latinoamerican and crime novels are my 
                                favourites.

                                Traveling is my most principal goal in the future. Meet new people is the most edifying 
                                thing, specially if they are from very different places.
