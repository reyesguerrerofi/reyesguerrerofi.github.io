        <h1>What is Smart City?</h1>
        <p>
                <h3>
                        The first question is what is meant by a ‘smart city’. The answer is, 
                        there is no universally accepted definition of a smart city. It means different things 
                        to different people. The conceptualisation of Smart City, therefore, varies from city to 
                        city and country to country, depending on the level of development, willingness to change 
                        and reform, resources and aspirations of the city residents. 
                </h3>

                <h3>
                        The purpose of the Smart Cities Mission in India for example is to drive economic growth and improve 
                        the quality of life of people by enabling local area development and harnessing technology, 
                        especially technology that leads to Smart outcomes. Area- based development will transform 
                        existing areas (retrofit and redevelop), including slums, into better planned ones, thereby 
                        improving liveability of the whole City. New areas (greenfield) will be developed around cities 
                        in order to accommodate the expanding population in urban areas. Application of Smart Solutions 
                        will enable cities to use technology, information and data to improve infrastructure and services. 
                        Comprehensive development in this way will improve quality of life, create employment and enhance 
                        incomes for all, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, leading to inclusive Cities.
