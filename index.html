        <h1>What is Smart City?</h1>
        <p>
                <h3>
                        The first question is what is meant by a ‘smart city’. The answer is, 
                        there is no universally accepted definition of a smart city. It means different things 
                        to different people. The conceptualisation of Smart City, therefore, varies from city to 
                        city and country to country, depending on the level of development, willingness to change 
                        and reform, resources and aspirations of the city residents. 
                </h3>

                <h3>
                        The purpose of the Smart Cities Mission in India for example is to drive economic growth and improve 
                        the quality of life of people by enabling local area development and harnessing technology, 
                        especially technology that leads to Smart outcomes. Area- based development will transform 
                        existing areas (retrofit and redevelop), including slums, into better planned ones, thereby 
                        improving liveability of the whole City. New areas (greenfield) will be developed around cities 
                        in order to accommodate the expanding population in urban areas. Application of Smart Solutions 
                        will enable cities to use technology, information and data to improve infrastructure and services. 
                        Comprehensive development in this way will improve quality of life, create employment and enhance 
                        incomes for all, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, leading to inclusive Cities.

                        It's the next generation of mobile internet connection and offers much faster data download and upload speeds.
                        Through greater use of the radio spectrum it will allow far more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time.

                        "Whatever we do now with our smartphones we'll be able to do faster and better," says Ian Fogg from OpenSignal, a mobile data analytics company.
                        "Think of smart glasses featuring augmented reality, mobile virtual reality, much higher quality video, the internet of things making cities smarter.
                        "But what's really exciting is all the new services that will be built that we can't foresee."

                        Driverless cars will be able to "talk" to each other and traffic management systems
                        Imagine swarms of drones co-operating to carry out search and rescue missions, fire assessments and traffic monitoring, all communicating wirelessly with each other and ground base stations over 5G networks.
                        Similarly, many think 5G will be crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and read live map and traffic data.
                        Mobile gamers should notice less delay - or latency - when pressing a button on a controller and seeing the effect on screen.
                        Mobile videos should be near instantaneous and glitch-free. Video calls should become clearer and less jerky. Wearable fitness devices could monitor your health in real time, alerting doctors as soon as any emergency arises.
